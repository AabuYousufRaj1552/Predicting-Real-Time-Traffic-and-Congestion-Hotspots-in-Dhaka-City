# Combined Model Analysis

This directory contains comparative analysis and visualizations across all implemented models.

## Contents
- `all-models-combined-plots.ipynb`: Comprehensive comparison notebook
- `all-model-classification-report.ipynb`: Detailed classification analysis
- Combined visualization plots comparing all models

## Key Comparisons
- **Accuracy vs Image Size**: How different input sizes affect each model
- **Training Time Analysis**: Computational efficiency comparison
- **Learning Curves**: Training progression across models
- **Confusion Matrices**: Classification performance breakdown
- **ROC Curves**: Model discrimination capabilities

## Generated Plots
- `Final_Accuracy_Comparison.png`: Overall accuracy comparison
- `Learning_Curves_Comparison_Adjusted.png`: Training progression
- `Training_Time_vs_Image_Size.png`: Efficiency analysis
- `Aggregated_Confusion_Matrix.png`: Combined classification results
- `ROC_Curve.png`: Performance discrimination analysis

## Usage
1. Run individual model notebooks first to generate JSON results
2. Open `all-models-combined-plots.ipynb` for comparative analysis
3. Use `all-model-classification-report.ipynb` for detailed metrics
